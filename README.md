# Dynamic Geospatial Mapping Of Dustbins
Based on a prototype of a dustbin status tracking device, this R Shiny application reports the live statuses of a number of dustbins across the city. This application was designed with the purpose of managing waste in a smart way. I have made use of the javascript library leaflet which helped me bring out the features in the app that makes it come to life.  The application also shows the data collected and also some basic visual analytics on the data which further help in answering some basic questions about the problem of waste management itself.  

The Shiny application can be found at : https://shiivong27.shinyapps.io/dynamic_geo-spatial_mapping_of_dustbins/  

R packages used:
